* [ ] Make quick command to add all directories in the current working
      directory
* [ ] make a separate list for wildcard dirs such as /home/user/* These will
      get expanded upon running tmux-sessionizer so they stay up to date.
* [ ] Allow tmux-sessionizer -a to accept a second argument being a path, if it
      is a relative path, we simply add it to the relative path list, if it
      matches multiple directories we can add it to the wildcard list
